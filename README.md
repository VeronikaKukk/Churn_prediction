# Churn prediction

A small data science project where I look at the data from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) and predict the churn of a customer. 

This includes overview of the data, data preprocessing, building and training five classification models and then evaluating the models.
